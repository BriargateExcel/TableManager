# BriargateExcel Table Manager
The VBA code in this repository allows the user to edit the contents of an Excel table.
There is extensive information on the process in the [BriargateExcel blog](http://BriargateExcel.com/).

There are examples and instructions on how to use the Table Manager in the [Wiki](https://github.com/BriargateExcel/TableManager/wiki).

### UserForms in Main Project
This is an incomplete experiment to build the UserForms in the main workbook rather than build them in the XLAM project. I was able to build the UserForms in the main workbook but I was unable to Show them.
